To add the Contracts route to App.tsx, you need to:

1. Add the import:
```typescript
const Contracts = lazy(() => import('@/pages/Contracts/Contracts'));
```

2. Add the route in the Routes section:
```typescript
<Route path="/contracts" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <MainLayout>
      <Contracts />
    </MainLayout>
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```
