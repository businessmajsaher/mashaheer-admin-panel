   - `/contact-support` - View contact info and submit tickets
   - `/help-support` - Browse help sections and FAQs

## ðŸ“Š What You'll See

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## ðŸ“‹ Database Tables Created

1. **legal_notices** - Legal content (privacy, terms, etc.)
2. **contact_support_info** - Contact information sections
3. **help_sections** - Help documentation sections
4. **faq_items** - Frequently asked questions
5. **support_tickets** - User support tickets
6. **support_ticket_responses** - Admin responses to tickets

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test the connection** using `/supabase-test`
2. **Customize the data** by editing through the admin interface
3. **Add real user authentication** when ready for production
4. **Deploy to production** with proper environment variables

## ðŸš¨ Production Notes

- The `user_id` column in `support_tickets` is currently nullable for demo data
- In production, you may want to restore the NOT NULL constraint
- Update support tickets with real user IDs when users are authenticated
- Consider adding more sophisticated search and filtering

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

Your legal and support features are now fully integrated with Supabase and ready for use! The mock data provides a great starting point, and you can customize everything through the admin interface.
