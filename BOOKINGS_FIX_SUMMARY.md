# ⚠️ OUTDATED - See BOOKINGS_FIX_COMPLETE.md

This document contained an initial analysis based on incorrect schema assumptions from README documentation.

**Please refer to `BOOKINGS_FIX_COMPLETE.md` for the actual fix based on the real database schema.**

## What Changed

After receiving the actual database schema, I discovered that:
- The README documentation did not match the production database
- The actual schema uses `booking_statuses` table with UUID foreign keys
- Field names are different (e.g., `scheduled_time` not `booking_date`)
- Additional fields exist for script management

All fixes have been implemented correctly in the new solution.
