# Bookings Fix - Verification Guide

## Quick Start
The bookings page has been fixed to work with your actual Supabase database schema. All changes are complete and ready to test.

## What Was Fixed

### Query Issues (The 400 Error)
The original error occurred because the query was trying to:
1. ❌ Join with `booking_statuses` using wrong syntax
2. ❌ Reference non-existent columns (`booking_date`, `special_requirements`, `script_content`)
3. ❌ Use VARCHAR status instead of UUID foreign key

### Solution Applied
All queries now correctly:
1. ✅ Join with `booking_statuses` table: `status:booking_statuses(id, name, description)`
2. ✅ Use actual column names: `scheduled_time`, `notes`, `script`
3. ✅ Handle `status_id` as UUID foreign key

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Basic Loading
```
1. Open admin panel
2. Navigate to Bookings page
3. Verify: Page loads without errors
4. Verify: Bookings table displays data
```

### 2. Test Data Display
Check that each booking shows:
- ✓ Service title and thumbnail
- ✓ Customer name and email
- ✓ Influencer name and email
- ✓ Scheduled time (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm)
- ✓ Status badge with appropriate color

### 3. Test Filters
- ✓ Filter by service (dropdown populates with services)
- ✓ Filter by status (dropdown populates with booking statuses)
- ✓ Filter by date range (from/to date pickers)
- ✓ Filters apply correctly and update results

### 4. Test Status Updates
- ✓ Status dropdown in Actions column shows all available statuses
- ✓ Changing status updates immediately
- ✓ Success message appears
- ✓ Table refreshes with new status

### 5. Test Booking Details Modal
Click "View Details" on any booking and verify:
- ✓ Modal opens with full booking information
- ✓ All fields display correctly:
  - Service, Customer, Influencer
  - Scheduled time and completed time
  - Notes, Script, Feedback
  - Script metadata (created at, approved at, rejected count)
- ✓ Form fields populate with current values
- ✓ Status dropdown shows all available statuses
- ✓ Update button saves changes
- ✓ Cancel button closes modal

### 6. Test Pagination
- ✓ Pagination controls appear if > 10 bookings
- ✓ Clicking page numbers loads correct data
- ✓ Total count displays correctly

## Expected API Call

The working API call should look like:
```
GET /rest/v1/bookings?select=*,service:services(title,thumbnail),influencer:profiles!influencer_id(name,email),customer:profiles!customer_id(name,email),status:booking_statuses(id,name,description)&offset=0&limit=10&order=created_at.desc
```

## Console Debugging

If you encounter issues, check browser console for:

### Successful Response Structure
```javascript
{
  data: [{
    id: "uuid",
    service_id: "uuid",
    influencer_id: "uuid",
    customer_id: "uuid",
    status_id: "uuid",
    scheduled_time: "timestamp",
    notes: "string",
    script: "string",
    // ... other fields
    service: { title: "...", thumbnail: "..." },
    influencer: { name: "...", email: "..." },
    customer: { name: "...", email: "..." },
    status: { id: "...", name: "...", description: "..." }
  }],
  total: number,
  page: number,
  limit: number
}
```

### Common Issues to Watch For

**Issue**: Bookings load but status shows "N/A"
- **Cause**: `booking_statuses` table is empty
- **Solution**: Populate the table with status records

**Issue**: Filters don't work
- **Cause**: Status filter passing status name instead of ID
- **Solution**: Already fixed - filters use status ID

**Issue**: Can't update booking
- **Cause**: Trying to update with old field names
- **Solution**: Already fixed - all updates use correct schema

## Database Requirements

### Ensure Booking Statuses Exist
Your `booking_statuses` table should have records like:
```sql
INSERT INTO booking_statuses (name, description, "order") VALUES
  ('Pending', 'Booking is pending approval', 1),
  ('Confirmed', 'Booking has been confirmed', 2),
  ('In Progress', 'Service is being delivered', 3),
  ('Completed', 'Service has been completed', 4),
  ('Cancelled', 'Booking was cancelled', 5);
```

If statuses don't exist, the status dropdown will be empty.

## Files Changed Summary

| File | Status | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| `bookingService.ts` | ✅ Complete | Rewritten to match actual schema |
| `booking.ts` (types) | ✅ Complete | Updated all interfaces |
| `Bookings.tsx` | ✅ Complete | Full component rewrite |

## No Migration Required

**Important**: Unlike initial assessment, NO database changes are needed. The database schema is correct; only the frontend code needed fixing.

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback, the old code is in git history. However, the old code will NOT work with your database - it was querying non-existent columns.

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase connection is active
3. Confirm `booking_statuses` table has records
4. Review the API call in Network tab
5. Check that all foreign keys in bookings table point to valid records
